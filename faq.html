heading: "CoEpi: Community Epidemiology in Action"  
description: Questions you may have about CoEpi.  
faq:
  - question: What does CoEpi do?
    answer: CoEpi is building mobile apps (for both iOS and Android) with a privacy-first approach to anonymous Bluetooth-based contact tracing, exposure matching, and symptom alerting to address the spread of COVID-19 and other transmissible illnesses (like colds and flu) in our communities. 
  - question: How does CoEpi ensure anonymity?
    answer: CoEpi users simply install the app to get started – there is no registration or information collected, and no profile is created. Users will enable Bluetooth tracking to enable them to detect proximity to other user. They can optionally enable location tracking, for the sole purpose of storing their own history on their device to be able to see the location where any exposure matches occurred: such information will not be uploaded without explicit consent. If the user begins experiencing any symptoms, they can optionally choose to anonymously share any information they want to with a server to be able to alert individuals they’ve closely encountered about their symptoms.
  - question: How does CoEpi do exposure matching and alerting if a user is anonymous?
    answer: When someone who uses CoEpi was in proximity of another potentially infectious CoEpi user, their app will notify them. They can either dismiss the alert, or opt in to check the server be told the symptoms reported so far, and locally on their device see the date/time/place of their proximity with the symptomatic user. The user will then be able to optionally enable periodic check-ins where the app will ask the user to report any symptoms they’ve noticed, what if anything they’re doing to reduce possible re-transmission, and will prompt the user to consent to share that information with other CoEpi users and/or public health officials if appropriate.
  - question: Is CoEpi working with the other Bluetooth-based contact tracing apps?
    answer: Yes! CoEpi is actively collaborating with members of dozens of other Bluetooth-based contact tracing efforts around the world. 
  - question: How is CoEpi different from other Bluetooth-based contact tracing apps?
    answer: Many of the other apps are collaborating with CoEpi on the shared Bluetooth protocol so our apps are interoperable. (See more in <a href="https://github.com/Co-Epi/CEN">this Github repo</a>.) The main difference between CoEpi and other contact tracing apps is that we are laser-focused on creating an app that’s useful for end users – like you and us – immediately. Communities of close contacts can begin protecting themselves with CoEpi immediately; there is no scale required to achieve benefit to closed user groups.
  - question: How can I help with CoEpi?
    answer: We’re an open source project, and we’d love your help! <a href="https://forms.gle/MLeKz9nerPvX8fwC8">Fill out this form</a> to sign up as an early tester for iOS and/or Android, and if you have other skills to contribute, let us know. We can always use more native mobile developers.
