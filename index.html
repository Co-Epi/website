				<h2><strong>Contain, control, and eradicate</strong> contagious illnesses by connecting with your community.</h2>
				<p>CoEpi is a privacy-first system for anonymous Bluetooth proximity-based exposure alerting based on voluntary symptom sharing. Communities of close contacts can begin protecting themselves with CoEpi immediately; we don't need millions of people to install the app, and we don't have to wait for testing to ramp up. By installing CoEpi and reporting symptoms, you and the people you interact with can create your own early warning system to detect and respond to any infectious disease.</p>

				<h2><strong>Collaborate. Inform. Protect.</strong></h2>
				<p>CoEpi is designed to protect individuals by bridging the gap between governmental public health actions and individual physical distancing efforts. We believe it is possible to combine modern smartphone technology and cloud computing to empower individuals and their personal networks to automatically and anonymously track their own contacts, and inform themselves and their friends and family about increased infection risks.</p>

				<h2>CoEpi is Open Source – and openly collaborating.</h2>
				<p>CoEpi is an open source project that is actively collaborating with others on a shared backend and Bluetooth protocol so these apps can ‘see’ each other as devices, expanding the impact of CoEpi.</p>

					<p class="editable">COVID-19 is here, in our communities, and people are dying. You, yes everyone, can start taking action today to slow the spread of #coronavirus. This isn’t normally true, but in this crisis you, personally, can save at least one life by putting #CoEpi, Community Epidemiology, into action. You can do it manually by talking to everyone you know about your own symptoms, asking about theirs, and being extra vigilant when you’re symptomatic or exposed, to prevent the transmission of contagious illnesses, break the chains of COVID-19 coronavirus transmission, and ultimately save the life of a parent, grandparent, or vulnerable relative of someone in your community. And in the future, you can use the CoEpi app to anonymously communicate and share symptoms with anyone else with a compatible app that you interact with.</p>
