				<h2>The CoEpi app vision</h2>
			
			
			<p>To fully unleash the power of community epidemiology (CoEpi), we are creating an app that empowers people to leverage their personal social network for better awareness of granular infection risks.</p>
<p>The CoEpi app will have utmost regard for personal privacy and will ask for permission when any sharing of sensitive data is needed.  It will only ask individuals to contribute their private data for the good of their community if they become unwell; even when this occurs, the system is designed to permit only the minimum necessary information to be revealed, such that the actual identity of the volunteer participants is maximally concealed.</p>
<p>The CoEpi mobile app will ask permission for everything it does, and will allow individuals to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>simply install the app to get started, without disclosing any personal information.</li>

<li><p>enable or disable tracking their own location history (only locally on their own device), with the ability to enable or disable such tracking on a scheduled, geofenced, or manual basis to avoid collecting any sensitive information the user would never wish to share.</li>

<li><p>enable or disable on-demand or background scanning for other compatible app users nearby using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and recording (only on the local device) the history of other devices seen by the app.</li>

<li><p>enable or disable contextual hygiene reminders, for example to remind them to wash or sanitize hands when arriving at a new location like home or work, and/or after being in proximity of large numbers of people, as indicated by a significant number of other BLE devices being in range for a significant period of time.</li>

<li><p>produce a report on the device which shows a timeline of personal location history, likely as either a timeline or a map. This report should be able to be emailed or printed on user request. The use case of this information is in its application to individual health care, and in manual contact tracing activity should an individual wish to still contribute to community good after diagnosis but decline to use the networked methodology below.</li>
<li><p>be alerted when other CoEpi users come into close range for an extended period of time, and if both users consent, allow them to register a close-contact connection between the devices, allowing either user to preferentially share more information with trusted close contacts than with acquaintances.</li>
<li><p>track their own respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. When tracking symptoms, the app will optionally prompt the user for additional updates on symptom progression, providing the user with a comprehensive illness history if the symptoms progress to the point of requiring medical attention.</li>
<li><p>consent to share any symptoms/results with close contacts, weaker recent contacts, future contacts, and/or public health officials.</li>
<li><p>be alerted, via push notification or by periodic anonymous polling, when another CoEpi user who has shared symptoms was nearby at any point when they may have been contagious.</li>
<li><p>invite anyone to begin using the app (and optionally, register as a close contact) via text message, email, QR code, custom shareable URL, etc. Users would be encouraged to invite people in their own social network, as the app will be most useful when the people you’re most likely to be sharing germs with are using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Community application of this system will allow visualisation of the distribution of suspected and actual cases of all respiratory and GI illnesses being actively transmitted in the community, most notably COVID-19. In partnership with local public health officials, it could be used to inform community control actions such as travel restrictions and voluntary quarantine. Global application of this or a similar and compatible system would dramatically improve the data that is made available to decision makers.</p>
<p>In the future, if successful this system could be re-used for more effective control of existing transmissible infectious diseases such as influenza and measles, as well as future pandemic diseases.</p>
<h2 id="symptom-reporting-and-sharing">Symptom reporting and sharing</h2>
<p>Once fully integrated with secure and anonymous cloud APIs, the full power of CoEpi will come from the ability to report and share symptoms, and perform automatic real-time contact matching and tracing at scale. Here’s how it would work from a user’s perspective:</p>
<p>When a user enters any symptoms or abnormal results, they will be asked to report the recollected date/time of symptom onset, the current severity of symptoms, from minimal to severe, the type of symptoms, and any additional details required based on the previous answers. They’ll then be prompted to choose whether to share full or partial symptom details for the benefit of others. They can choose to share with close contacts, and/or with weaker recent contacts, future contacts, and/or public health officials.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Close contacts would be already-registered in-person contacts as described above.</li>
<li><p>Weaker contacts would be any other CoEpi users who have come into BLE range of the affected user’s app while potentially infectious, even if it didn’t result in a close contact registration.</li>
<li><p>Future contacts would be all CoEpi users who come in range of the affected user during the period when they might remain infectious.</li>
<li><p>Public health officials (and potentially epidemiological researchers) could choose to receive anonymized symptom reports from CoEpi users who optionally choose to share them. If the individual wishes to participate, the app could additionally request permission to upload approximate locations visited during each time period for public health purposes. This approximation could be done by converting the GPS coordinates to a geohash, for example the 5 character precision with a reported accuracy of +/- 2.4km.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any reports of severe symptoms will be prompted and advised how to immediately contact local health services for advice on when/how to engage with the healthcare system. Reports of severe symptoms shared with contacts will be provided only on general terms. If a user reports having received an official diagnosis or having required hospitalization, that information will only be shared with public health officials, so they can link the patient’s CoEpi record with their official medical records as needed, and choose whether/how to perform any contact tracing or otherwise alert/contact any CoEpi users with contact matches.</p>
<h2 id="contact-matching-and-alerting">Contact matching and alerting</h2>
<p>When someone who was in proximity of a potentially infectious CoEpi user is notified of the fact, they’ll be told about the details of the symptoms reported so far, the date/time/place of their proximity with the potentially affected user, whether or not the person is a registered close contact, and they’ll be provided with guidance as to actions they should take: being on the lookout for symptoms, extra attention to hygiene, etc. For more dangerous symptoms consistent with COVID or influenza, they may also receive recommendations to begin practicing social distancing measures, working from home if possible, etc., and instructions on how to call their healthcare providers for guidance on what to do next.
The user will then be able to optionally enable periodic check-ins where the app will ask the user to report any symptoms they’ve noticed, what if anything they’re doing to reduce possible re-transmission, and will prompt the user to consent to share that information with other CoEpi users and/or public health officials if appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="completely-free-and-open-source">Completely free and open source</h2>
<p>The CoEpi app and server code will be completely open-source and free to use.</p>
<p>There will be a main publicly-available server run by the CoEpi community to handle new app registration, symptom and test reporting, etc. This server will endeavor not to retain any PII from individuals. Client IP addresses will not be stored in a database or recorded in log files any longer than necessary. Phone numbers and email addresses will not be linked to the user in any way. There will be no “user accounts” on the server with usernames and passwords: if someone gets a new phone, they’ll need to re-register all their close contacts the next time they come in contact.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn’t trust the community-run server, or who wants to run their own for any other reason, can run their own server and invite people in their social network to (also) use that one. Anyone can read from multiple servers, and choose one or more of those servers to submit symptoms/tests to. We may choose to implement FHIR integration or similar to allow health systems to run their own server so patients can choose to report symptoms to and receive test results from the hospital’s EHR.</p>
<h2 id="additional-details">Additional details</h2>
